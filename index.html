    <h2>Answer</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt><b>Inline elements </b>

        </dt>
        <dd> Inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. <br>
            They typically flow within the content of a block-level element, allowing other inline elements to sit beside them. <br>
            Examples of inline elements: span, a, img, input, button, label,  etc.</dd> <br><br>
                <dt><b>Block elements </b></dt>
                <dd>Block elements always start on a new line and take up the full width available. <br>
                    They create a visual "block" of content and will typically break the flow of content, causing subsequent elements to appear on a new line. <br><br>
                    Examples of block elements :div, p, h1 to h6, ul, ol, li, table, form, etc.</dd>
